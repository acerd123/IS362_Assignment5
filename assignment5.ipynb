    "In conclusion, adding the top 10 northernmost airports in the United States provided a clearer picture of the actual northernmost airport, as previous research suggested otherwise. Additionally, existing research did not identify Eareckson Air Station as the easternmost airport in the U.S., likely because it is no longer an active civilian airport and is primarily used for refueling and emergency diversions. Initially, my research and dataset indicated that Newark Airport was the windiest airport on February 12, 2013. However, since Newark is not located in New York, I modified the code to ensure that only New York airports were considered."
